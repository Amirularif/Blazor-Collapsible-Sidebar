# Blazor Collapsible Sidebar

This project provides a simple implementation of a collapsible sidebar for the default Blazor Web App Sidebar. The sidebar can be toggled between a full (expand state) and a minimal width (collapse state). I was trying to find a way on how to achieve this online but couldn't find one, so I tried myself and managed. I'm sharing this simple trick to help people who are trying to achieve this too.
