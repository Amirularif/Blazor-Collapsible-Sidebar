# Blazor Collapsible Sidebar

This project provides a simple implementation of a collapsible sidebar for the default Blazor Web App Sidebar. The sidebar can be toggled between a full (expand state) and a minimal width (collapse state). I was trying to find a way on how to achieve this online but couldn't find one, so I tried myself and managed. I'm sharing this simple trick to help people who are trying to achieve this too.

## Features

- **Expandable and Collapsible:** Click to expand or collapse the sidebar to a minimal icon view.
- **Smooth Transitions:** Animated transitions for expanding and collapsing the sidebar.
- **Customizable:** Easy to customize with CSS for your specific needs.
